# Mini-Spec — Delivery Copilot

**Customer/Org:** Internal (Tayel)  
**Target release:** Week 1 end

## Problem statement
I need a repeatable way to turn a vague request into a mini-spec, backlog, and weekly status updates to run delivery like a pro.

## Success criteria
- Generate MINI-SPEC.md, BACKLOG.md, STATUS.md from one intake file
- Docs are clear enough that another person can follow them
